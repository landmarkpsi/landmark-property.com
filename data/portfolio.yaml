      - The suburbs can wait. We have your plan to move to the Fan. Pastel shops and local restaurants are a sharp contrast to the beige and bland of commercial chains and cookie cutter construction. Yet, the vintage charm and low key atmosphere form a similar contrast to the swanky streets of Shockoe Bottom. As fans of the Fan, we knew that there was no better place for our signature apartment community - Landmark at 1700. Our community will feature 22 apartments, each with a unique layout to match the eclectic architectural style of the neighborhood. Contact us today for more information!
